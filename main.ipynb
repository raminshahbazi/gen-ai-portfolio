Most existing research on\\\\nevaluating cultural alignment in LLMs involves simply analyzing their responses to questions about their preferences\\\\n[37]. For example, the CDEval benchmark evaluates cultural dimensions in LLMs using questions designed to assess six\\\\ncultural dimensions [49]. However, modern LLMs – and their expressed ‘preferences’ – are complex [30]. This leads us\\\\nto ask whether current evaluation methods can adequately characterize the cultural alignment of LLMs.', 'Current methods for assessing cultural alignment borrow frameworks from social science methodologies [29] but\\\\ntypically reduce to asking LLMs questions about their ‘preferences’ without necessarily implementing the systematic\\\\nvalidation practices that establish robust findings.

Core assumptions about LLM cultural alignment fail under systematic evaluation.', 'Our experiments reveal that cultural\\\\nalignment in LLMs is: (1) not stable (Section 5.1 , Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6) - response variations from trivial\\\\nformat changes often exceed real-world cultural differences; (2) not extrapolable (Section 5.2 , Figure 7) - extrapolation from limited\\\\ndimensions produces near-random clustering results, with strong sensitivity to which dimensions are included; and (3) not steerable\\\\n(Section 5.3 , Figure 8) - even optimized prompting techniques produce erratic, un-humanlike response patterns that fail to align with\\\\ncultural perspectives. humans whose values often show consistent patterns, are known to express inconsistent ideas across different contexts\\\\n[3, 14, 43, 52, 53]. Without proper validation, conclusions about LLMs’ cultural alignment may reflect evaluation design\\\\nchoices rather than the models’ actual properties.', 'Here, we investigate the reliability of current survey-based cultural alignment evaluations by identifying and testing\\\\nthree key assumptions from prior works (see Figure 1):\\\\n• Stability: Cultural alignment manifests as a property of LLMs rather than an artifact of evaluation design. • Extrapolability: Alignment with one culture on a narrow set of issues predicts alignment with that culture on\\\\nother issues. • Steerability: LLMs can consistently be made to embody specific cultural perspectives through prompting. To test these assumptions, we use both explicit evaluation methods, using established cultural assessments[13, 19],\\\\nand implicit evaluations that examine LLM behavior through a simulated hiring scenario. We make three contributions\\\\nto understanding and evaluating cultural alignment in LLMs:\\\\n(1) We observe three assumptions in the cultural alignment evaluation literature: stability, extrapolability, and\\\\nsteerability.', 'Manuscript submitted to ACM\\\\n\\\\nRandomness, Not Representation: The Unreliability of Evaluating Cultural Alignment in LLMs\\\\n3\\\\n(2) We reveal significant inconsistencies in these widely held assumptions through a series of experiments involving\\\\nexplicit and implicit preference elicitation. (3) We demonstrate how subtle variations in evaluation methodology can dramatically shift conclusions about\\\\nLLMs’ cultural alignment. We also present a case study showing that high-level findings on LLM preferences\\\\nby Mazeika et al. [32] do not replicate when the LLM is evaluated with the option of expressing indifference\\\\nbetween alternatives. Our findings suggest that current, popular methods for evaluating cultural alignment in LLMs require critical\\\\nre-examination, as they risk oversimplifying or misrepresenting results.', 'The high sensitivity of LLM responses to\\\\nsubtle methodological choices indicates that narrow experiments or a selective assessment of evidence may paint an\\\\nincomplete picture of these systems’ cultural alignment properties. These results point to opportunities for developing\\\\nmore robust evaluation frameworks that better capture the complex and variable nature of LLM behavior. 2\\\\nRelated Work\\\\n2.1\\\\nCultural Alignment in Language Models\\\\nAn LLM’s ‘alignment’ with a culture describes the degree to which its behaviors reflect common beliefs within that\\\\nculture regarding what is considered desirable and proper [37]. As language models have become increasingly capable\\\\nof generating human-like text, researchers have focused on analyzing how the behaviors of these models reflect or\\\\ndiverge from different cultural perspectives [9].', 'Some early work in cultural alignment has highlighted that LLMs tend\\\\nto reflect values aligned with WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) societies [23], leading\\\\nto the perpetuation of cultural biases and the misrepresentation of non-WEIRD worldviews. This recognition has led\\\\nresearchers to adapt social science methodologies to evaluate cultural representation in LLMs [15]. 2.2\\\\nEvaluating Cultural Alignment\\\\nTwo main methodological approaches have emerged for assessing cultural alignment. The more common paradigm\\\\nhas been discriminative assessment, which adapts traditional survey techniques by requiring models to select from\\\\npredetermined options to evaluate their preferences and biases [2, 4, 9, 31, 33]. For example, recent work by Mazeika\\\\net al. [32] studies LLM ‘preferences’ by having them select a binary preference between two outcomes (e.g., “saving 10\\\\nlives in the United States” versus “saving 10 lives in Nigeria”).', 'In contrast, generative approaches analyze free-form model outputs, similar to qualitative methods in social science\\\\nresearch [1, 45]. These can be implemented through both single-turn assessment, where cultural context and probe are\\\\ngiven in one prompt, and multi-turn assessment, which evaluates responses over several interactions [1]. 2.3\\\\nSurvey-Based Assessments\\\\nBuilding on discriminative assessment, researchers have developed benchmarks to evaluate model responses across\\\\ncultural contexts, from politics to religion [13]. These include the Value Survey Module (VSM) [19] which assesses six\\\\ncultural dimensions through a structured 24-question survey, and the Global Opinion Q&A dataset (GQA) [13] which\\\\ncombines World Values Survey (WVS) and Pew Research questions to assess model responses across cultural contexts\\\\n[13]. Based on these surveys, recent work has introduced benchmarks for assessing cultural alignment in LLMs [2, 4, 9, 27,\\\\n31, 45, 49, 51].', 'However, prior studies examining survey-based approaches have revealed important methodological\\\\nManuscript submitted to ACM\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\nAriba Khan∗, Stephen Casper∗, and Dylan Hadfield-Menell\\\\nlimitations. For instance, Arora et al. [4] found that while multilingual pre-trained language models can learn cross-\\\\ncultural value differences, their study found a weak correlation with human survey responses. Additionally, researchers\\\\nhave highlighted how LLMs’ preferences can be sensitive to prompting [40]. This suggests that survey methods can fail\\\\nto capture and contextualize the nuances of LLMs’ cultural preferences. 3\\\\nIdentifying Key Assumptions\\\\nIn this section, we identify three foundational assumptions that underlie current approaches to evaluating cultural\\\\nalignment in LLMs.', '3.1\\\\nStability\\\\nStability Assumption\\\\nCultural alignment manifests as a property of LLMs that remains consistent across semantic-preserving\\\\nvariations in evaluation methodology, rather than being primarily an artifact of specific prompt design choices. This assumption does not claim LLM outputs never vary with prompt changes (which would be trivially false). Rather, it posits that superficial evaluation design choices should not dramatically alter conclusions about an LLM’s\\\\ncultural values, just as survey methodology variations should not fundamentally change our understanding of human\\\\ncultural values. Prior research has studied cultural alignment using methods adapted from the social sciences, such as the World\\\\nValues Survey [17] and Values Survey Module [19]. These approaches typically involve presenting LLMs with culturally\\\\nrelevant survey questions and comparing their responses against human data to assess cultural biases or alignments\\\\n[2, 4, 9, 31, 49].', 'Across these evaluation frameworks, much of the existing research attributes observed patterns of\\\\ncultural bias directly to the models’ training processes [2, 4, 13, 23, 27, 31, 45, 48, 49]. However, emerging evidence prompts us to question whether cultural alignment is a stable property of an LLM,\\\\nsuggesting that LLM behaviors and preferences can be sensitive to minor variations in prompt design [3, 11, 12, 14, 16,\\\\n43, 46, 52, 53]. Wang et al. [49] systematically quantified cultural response variations across different prompt formats,\\\\nfinding that models exhibited varying degrees of stability across three question styles, leading them to use weighted\\\\naveraging to account for template-specific instabilities. Röttger et al. [40] revealed that small shifts in prompt phrasing\\\\ncan produce variations larger than the differences between distinct real-world cultural positions.', 'Building on this prior\\\\nwork, which has shown basic prompt sensitivity using direct questions about values, in this paper, we systematically\\\\nexamine how different evaluation approaches, including assessment of implicit biases, affect cultural response patterns. 3.2\\\\nExtrapolability\\\\nExtrapolability Assumption\\\\nAlignment with one culture on a narrow set of issues reliably predicts alignment with that culture on other\\\\nunobserved issues, such that a limited sample of cultural dimensions is sufficient to characterize an LLM’s\\\\noverall cultural alignment. Manuscript submitted to ACM\\\\n\\\\nRandomness, Not Representation: The Unreliability of Evaluating Cultural Alignment in LLMs\\\\n5\\\\nPrevious research evaluating the cultural alignment of LLMs has frequently used cultural dimensional frameworks,\\\\nsuch as Hofstede’s cultural dimensions,1 to evaluate alignment.', 'This offers a useful lens into LLM preferences, but\\\\nstudies [4, 9, 31] have identified consistently weak correlations between LLM outputs and established cultural value\\\\nsurveys, while others [6, 34] found contradictory patterns in alignment across different values. Based on apparent LLM\\\\nalignment with certain cultures on specific issues, some past works have concluded that LLMs align with those cultures\\\\nin general [6, 31, 41] despite evidence of inconsistent alignment patterns. However, evidence from both human behavior and recent LLM evaluations casts doubt on extrapolability. In human\\\\nstudies, cultural dimensions exhibit only partial correlation, with substantial variation driven by unique country-specific\\\\nfactors [7]. These findings indicate that cultures cannot be reliably classified or characterized using a small number\\\\nof cultural dimensions. Language models can demonstrate similar patterns of unexpected preferences across cultural\\\\ndimensions. For example, Tao et al.', '[45] found that while GPT models consistently exhibit self-expression biases, they\\\\ndisplay considerable variation between secular versus traditional values. Meanwhile, Wang et al. [49] observed that\\\\nGPT-4’s high uncertainty avoidance in the wellness domain contrasts with its general trend. Similarly, in the context\\\\nof political and ideological alignment, Santurkar et al. [41] found that typically ‘liberal’ models like text-davinci-002\\\\nand text-davinci-003 express notably ‘conservative’ views on religious topics. In this paper, we build on prior work\\\\nto statistically investigate the interplay between different cultural dimensions and test whether alignment on certain\\\\ndimensions reliably predicts alignment on others in both LLMs and humans.', '3.3\\\\nSteerability\\\\nSteerability Assumption\\\\nSufficiently detailed and context-rich instructions can reliably prompt an LLM to adopt coherent cultural\\\\nstances that accurately reflect specific human cultural perspectives, allowing consistent modulation of an\\\\nLLM’s cultural expression through prompting. Prompting remains the most common method for steering LLMs toward specific behaviors or cultural perspectives,\\\\noften referred to as “persona modulation” in the literature [4, 21, 35, 37, 44]. For instance, AlKhamissi et al. [2] introduced\\\\n‘anthropological prompting,’ which incorporates cultural context and reasoning frameworks to “shift responses toward\\\\ncultural norms of underrepresented personas in Egyptian and American contexts.”\\\\nDespite past efforts, it is unclear the extent to which LLMs can reliably embody the assigned persona. One cause for\\\\ndoubt is that LLM fine-tuning methods (e.g., RLHF) tend to optimize for annotator approval, which is not guaranteed\\\\nto make LLMs take on accurate personas [10, 13].', 'Meanwhile, Tao et al. [45] observe that cultural prompting can\\\\nincrease alignment for some countries while failing or even exacerbating bias for others. Meanwhile, Kovač et al. [27] demonstrate that different “perspective induction” techniques can yield inconsistent results across tasks and\\\\nmodel architectures. In this paper, we go beyond evaluating steerability in narrow contexts to show fundamental\\\\nfailures of LLMs to express humanlike preferences, let alone embody specific cultural perspectives, even under prompt\\\\noptimization. 1Power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, masculinity vs. femininity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation vs. short-term orientation, and\\\\nindulgence vs. restraint.

These models represent diverse architectures, releases (closed- and\\\\nopen-weight), and developers. To ensure deterministic outputs, all experiments used zero-temperature settings. 4.2\\\\nCultural Alignment Assessment Frameworks\\\\nWe evaluated LLM cultural alignment using various question/answer surveys as described below. Specific prompts\\\\nare in Appendix A. All tests involved asking LLMs questions and eliciting responses on a Likert scale (e.g., strongly\\\\ndisagree, slightly disagree, neutral, slightly agree, strongly agree). For all numerical analysis, we continuously embedded\\\\nLikert-scale responses using evenly-spaced values from 0 to 1 (e.g., 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0). 4.2.1\\\\nExplicit Value Assessment: Surveys.', 'To directly assess LLM statements about what values they prefer, we use the\\\\nValue Survey Module (VSM) and Global Opinion Q&A (GQA). Value Survey Module (VSM). The VSM survey (also known as Hofstede’s Cultural Survey) consists of 24 standardized\\\\nquestions measuring Hofstede’s cultural dimensions and aggregated human responses from residents of more than\\\\n100 countries. We limited our analysis to 65 countries that had complete survey data across all cultural dimensions. To maintain methodological consistency, we adapted the original VSM questions from second-person to third-person\\\\nformat while preserving their semantic meaning. All questions used a 5-point Likert scale (1: Strongly agree, 2: Agree,\\\\n3: Undecided, 4: Disagree, 5: Strongly disagree). We calculated cultural dimension values using the VSM Manual’s\\\\nstandardized equations, setting all constants to zero. Global Opinion QA (GQA).', 'The GQA dataset offers an additional method for analyzing global opinion distributions\\\\nacross an expanded question corpus, enabling comparisons between LLM responses and country-specific human\\\\nresponse patterns. From GQA, we subsampled 180 Likert-scale questions and responses from 15 countries2, selecting\\\\nonly questions with complete responses across all 15 countries. We manually reordered each question’s options to\\\\nmaintain proper Likert scaling. 4.2.2\\\\nImplicit Value Assessment: Job Hiring Sandbox. Cover Letter Evaluation Task. To assess implicit cultural preferences through decision-making scenarios, we\\\\ndesigned a job application evaluation task where cultural values significantly influence the selection process.

As language models have become increasingly capable\\nof generating human-like text, researchers have focused on analyzing how the behaviors of these models reflect or\\ndiverge from different cultural perspectives [9].', 'Some early work in cultural alignment has highlighted that LLMs tend\\nto reflect values aligned with WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) societies [23], leading\\nto the perpetuation of cultural biases and the misrepresentation of non-WEIRD worldviews. This recognition has led\\nresearchers to adapt social science methodologies to evaluate cultural representation in LLMs [15]. 2.2\\nEvaluating Cultural Alignment\\nTwo main methodological approaches have emerged for assessing cultural alignment. The more common paradigm\\nhas been discriminative assessment, which adapts traditional survey techniques by requiring models to select from\\npredetermined options to evaluate their preferences and biases [2, 4, 9, 31, 33]. For example, recent work by Mazeika\\net al. [32] studies LLM ‘preferences’ by having them select a binary preference between two outcomes (e.g., “saving 10\\nlives in the United States” versus “saving 10 lives in Nigeria”).', 'In contrast, generative approaches analyze free-form model outputs, similar to qualitative methods in social science\\nresearch [1, 45]. These can be implemented through both single-turn assessment, where cultural context and probe are\\ngiven in one prompt, and multi-turn assessment, which evaluates responses over several interactions [1]. 2.3\\nSurvey-Based Assessments\\nBuilding on discriminative assessment, researchers have developed benchmarks to evaluate model responses across\\ncultural contexts, from politics to religion [13]. These include the Value Survey Module (VSM) [19] which assesses six\\ncultural dimensions through a structured 24-question survey, and the Global Opinion Q&A dataset (GQA) [13] which\\ncombines World Values Survey (WVS) and Pew Research questions to assess model responses across cultural contexts\\n[13]. Based on these surveys, recent work has introduced benchmarks for assessing cultural alignment in LLMs [2, 4, 9, 27,\\n31, 45, 49, 51].', 'However, prior studies examining survey-based approaches have revealed important methodological\\nManuscript submitted to ACM\\n\\n4\\nAriba Khan∗, Stephen Casper∗, and Dylan Hadfield-Menell\\nlimitations. For instance, Arora et al. [4] found that while multilingual pre-trained language models can learn cross-\\ncultural value differences, their study found a weak correlation with human survey responses. Additionally, researchers\\nhave highlighted how LLMs’ preferences can be sensitive to prompting [40]. This suggests that survey methods can fail\\nto capture and contextualize the nuances of LLMs’ cultural preferences. 3\\nIdentifying Key Assumptions\\nIn this section, we identify three foundational assumptions that underlie current approaches to evaluating cultural\\nalignment in LLMs.', '3.1\\nStability\\nStability Assumption\\nCultural alignment manifests as a property of LLMs that remains consistent across semantic-preserving\\nvariations in evaluation methodology, rather than being primarily an artifact of specific prompt design choices. This assumption does not claim LLM outputs never vary with prompt changes (which would be trivially false). Rather, it posits that superficial evaluation design choices should not dramatically alter conclusions about an LLM’s\\ncultural values, just as survey methodology variations should not fundamentally change our understanding of human\\ncultural values. Prior research has studied cultural alignment using methods adapted from the social sciences, such as the World\\nValues Survey [17] and Values Survey Module [19]. These approaches typically involve presenting LLMs with culturally\\nrelevant survey questions and comparing their responses against human data to assess cultural biases or alignments\\n[2, 4, 9, 31, 49].', 'Across these evaluation frameworks, much of the existing research attributes observed patterns of\\ncultural bias directly to the models’ training processes [2, 4, 13, 23, 27, 31, 45, 48, 49]. However, emerging evidence prompts us to question whether cultural alignment is a stable property of an LLM,\\nsuggesting that LLM behaviors and preferences can be sensitive to minor variations in prompt design [3, 11, 12, 14, 16,\\n43, 46, 52, 53]. Wang et al. [49] systematically quantified cultural response variations across different prompt formats,\\nfinding that models exhibited varying degrees of stability across three question styles, leading them to use weighted\\naveraging to account for template-specific instabilities. Röttger et al. [40] revealed that small shifts in prompt phrasing\\ncan produce variations larger than the differences between distinct real-world cultural positions.', 'Building on this prior\\nwork, which has shown basic prompt sensitivity using direct questions about values, in this paper, we systematically\\nexamine how different evaluation approaches, including assessment of implicit biases, affect cultural response patterns. 3.2\\nExtrapolability\\nExtrapolability Assumption\\nAlignment with one culture on a narrow set of issues reliably predicts alignment with that culture on other\\nunobserved issues, such that a limited sample of cultural dimensions is sufficient to characterize an LLM’s\\noverall cultural alignment. Manuscript submitted to ACM\\n\\nRandomness, Not Representation: The Unreliability of Evaluating Cultural Alignment in LLMs\\n5\\nPrevious research evaluating the cultural alignment of LLMs has frequently used cultural dimensional frameworks,\\nsuch as Hofstede’s cultural dimensions,1 to evaluate alignment.', 'This offers a useful lens into LLM preferences, but\\nstudies [4, 9, 31] have identified consistently weak correlations between LLM outputs and established cultural value\\nsurveys, while others [6, 34] found contradictory patterns in alignment across different values. Based on apparent LLM\\nalignment with certain cultures on specific issues, some past works have concluded that LLMs align with those cultures\\nin general [6, 31, 41] despite evidence of inconsistent alignment patterns. However, evidence from both human behavior and recent LLM evaluations casts doubt on extrapolability. In human\\nstudies, cultural dimensions exhibit only partial correlation, with substantial variation driven by unique country-specific\\nfactors [7]. These findings indicate that cultures cannot be reliably classified or characterized using a small number\\nof cultural dimensions. Language models can demonstrate similar patterns of unexpected preferences across cultural\\ndimensions. For example, Tao et al.', '[45] found that while GPT models consistently exhibit self-expression biases, they\\ndisplay considerable variation between secular versus traditional values. Meanwhile, Wang et al. [49] observed that\\nGPT-4’s high uncertainty avoidance in the wellness domain contrasts with its general trend. Similarly, in the context\\nof political and ideological alignment, Santurkar et al. [41] found that typically ‘liberal’ models like text-davinci-002\\nand text-davinci-003 express notably ‘conservative’ views on religious topics. In this paper, we build on prior work\\nto statistically investigate the interplay between different cultural dimensions and test whether alignment on certain\\ndimensions reliably predicts alignment on others in both LLMs and humans.', '3.3\\nSteerability\\nSteerability Assumption\\nSufficiently detailed and context-rich instructions can reliably prompt an LLM to adopt coherent cultural\\nstances that accurately reflect specific human cultural perspectives, allowing consistent modulation of an\\nLLM’s cultural expression through prompting. Prompting remains the most common method for steering LLMs toward specific behaviors or cultural perspectives,\\noften referred to as “persona modulation” in the literature [4, 21, 35, 37, 44]. For instance, AlKhamissi et al. [2] introduced\\n‘anthropological prompting,’ which incorporates cultural context and reasoning frameworks to “shift responses toward\\ncultural norms of underrepresented personas in Egyptian and American contexts.”\\nDespite past efforts, it is unclear the extent to which LLMs can reliably embody the assigned persona. One cause for\\ndoubt is that LLM fine-tuning methods (e.g., RLHF) tend to optimize for annotator approval, which is not guaranteed\\nto make LLMs take on accurate personas [10, 13].', 'Meanwhile, Tao et al. [45] observe that cultural prompting can\\nincrease alignment for some countries while failing or even exacerbating bias for others. Meanwhile, Kovač et al. [27] demonstrate that different “perspective induction” techniques can yield inconsistent results across tasks and\\nmodel architectures. In this paper, we go beyond evaluating steerability in narrow contexts to show fundamental\\nfailures of LLMs to express humanlike preferences, let alone embody specific cultural perspectives, even under prompt\\noptimization. 1Power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, masculinity vs. femininity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation vs. short-term orientation, and\\nindulgence vs. restraint.

These models represent diverse architectures, releases (closed- and\\nopen-weight), and developers. To ensure deterministic outputs, all experiments used zero-temperature settings. 4.2\\nCultural Alignment Assessment Frameworks\\nWe evaluated LLM cultural alignment using various question/answer surveys as described below. Specific prompts\\nare in Appendix A. All tests involved asking LLMs questions and eliciting responses on a Likert scale (e.g., strongly\\ndisagree, slightly disagree, neutral, slightly agree, strongly agree). For all numerical analysis, we continuously embedded\\nLikert-scale responses using evenly-spaced values from 0 to 1 (e.g., 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0). 4.2.1\\nExplicit Value Assessment: Surveys.', 'To directly assess LLM statements about what values they prefer, we use the\\nValue Survey Module (VSM) and Global Opinion Q&A (GQA). Value Survey Module (VSM). The VSM survey (also known as Hofstede’s Cultural Survey) consists of 24 standardized\\nquestions measuring Hofstede’s cultural dimensions and aggregated human responses from residents of more than\\n100 countries. We limited our analysis to 65 countries that had complete survey data across all cultural dimensions. To maintain methodological consistency, we adapted the original VSM questions from second-person to third-person\\nformat while preserving their semantic meaning. All questions used a 5-point Likert scale (1: Strongly agree, 2: Agree,\\n3: Undecided, 4: Disagree, 5: Strongly disagree). We calculated cultural dimension values using the VSM Manual’s\\nstandardized equations, setting all constants to zero. Global Opinion QA (GQA).', 'The GQA dataset offers an additional method for analyzing global opinion distributions\\nacross an expanded question corpus, enabling comparisons between LLM responses and country-specific human\\nresponse patterns. From GQA, we subsampled 180 Likert-scale questions and responses from 15 countries2, selecting\\nonly questions with complete responses across all 15 countries. We manually reordered each question’s options to\\nmaintain proper Likert scaling. 4.2.2\\nImplicit Value Assessment: Job Hiring Sandbox. Cover Letter Evaluation Task. To assess implicit cultural preferences through decision-making scenarios, we\\ndesigned a job application evaluation task where cultural values significantly influence the selection process. This\\napproach was inspired by the growing adoption of LLMs in recruitment workflows [24]. We used the ShashiVish/cover-\\nletter-dataset [47], which comprises 813 cover letters predominantly from technology sector job applications.']\n",

[4] found that while multilingual pre-trained language models can learn cross-\\\\ncultural value differences, their study found a weak correlation with human survey responses. Additionally, researchers\\\\nhave highlighted how LLMs’ preferences can be sensitive to prompting [40]. This suggests that survey methods can fail\\\\nto capture and contextualize the nuances of LLMs’ cultural preferences. 3\\\\nIdentifying Key Assumptions\\\\nIn this section, we identify three foundational assumptions that underlie current approaches to evaluating cultural\\\\nalignment in LLMs.', '3.1\\\\nStability\\\\nStability Assumption\\\\nCultural alignment manifests as a property of LLMs that remains consistent across semantic-preserving\\\\nvariations in evaluation methodology, rather than being primarily an artifact of specific prompt design choices. This assumption does not claim LLM outputs never vary with prompt changes (which would be trivially false). Rather, it posits that superficial evaluation design choices should not dramatically alter conclusions about an LLM’s\\\\ncultural values, just as survey methodology variations should not fundamentally change our understanding of human\\\\ncultural values. Prior research has studied cultural alignment using methods adapted from the social sciences, such as the World\\\\nValues Survey [17] and Values Survey Module [19]. These approaches typically involve presenting LLMs with culturally\\\\nrelevant survey questions and comparing their responses against human data to assess cultural biases or alignments\\\\n[2, 4, 9, 31, 49].', 'Across these evaluation frameworks, much of the existing research attributes observed patterns of\\\\ncultural bias directly to the models’ training processes [2, 4, 13, 23, 27, 31, 45, 48, 49]. However, emerging evidence prompts us to question whether cultural alignment is a stable property of an LLM,\\\\nsuggesting that LLM behaviors and preferences can be sensitive to minor variations in prompt design [3, 11, 12, 14, 16,\\\\n43, 46, 52, 53]. Wang et al. [49] systematically quantified cultural response variations across different prompt formats,\\\\nfinding that models exhibited varying degrees of stability across three question styles, leading them to use weighted\\\\naveraging to account for template-specific instabilities. Röttger et al. [40] revealed that small shifts in prompt phrasing\\\\ncan produce variations larger than the differences between distinct real-world cultural positions.', 'Building on this prior\\\\nwork, which has shown basic prompt sensitivity using direct questions about values, in this paper, we systematically\\\\nexamine how different evaluation approaches, including assessment of implicit biases, affect cultural response patterns. 3.2\\\\nExtrapolability\\\\nExtrapolability Assumption\\\\nAlignment with one culture on a narrow set of issues reliably predicts alignment with that culture on other\\\\nunobserved issues, such that a limited sample of cultural dimensions is sufficient to characterize an LLM’s\\\\noverall cultural alignment. Manuscript submitted to ACM\\\\n\\\\nRandomness, Not Representation: The Unreliability of Evaluating Cultural Alignment in LLMs\\\\n5\\\\nPrevious research evaluating the cultural alignment of LLMs has frequently used cultural dimensional frameworks,\\\\nsuch as Hofstede’s cultural dimensions,1 to evaluate alignment.', 'This offers a useful lens into LLM preferences, but\\\\nstudies [4, 9, 31] have identified consistently weak correlations between LLM outputs and established cultural value\\\\nsurveys, while others [6, 34] found contradictory patterns in alignment across different values. Based on apparent LLM\\\\nalignment with certain cultures on specific issues, some past works have concluded that LLMs align with those cultures\\\\nin general [6, 31, 41] despite evidence of inconsistent alignment patterns. However, evidence from both human behavior and recent LLM evaluations casts doubt on extrapolability. In human\\\\nstudies, cultural dimensions exhibit only partial correlation, with substantial variation driven by unique country-specific\\\\nfactors [7]. These findings indicate that cultures cannot be reliably classified or characterized using a small number\\\\nof cultural dimensions. Language models can demonstrate similar patterns of unexpected preferences across cultural\\\\ndimensions. For example, Tao et al.', '[45] found that while GPT models consistently exhibit self-expression biases, they\\\\ndisplay considerable variation between secular versus traditional values. Meanwhile, Wang et al. [49] observed that\\\\nGPT-4’s high uncertainty avoidance in the wellness domain contrasts with its general trend. Similarly, in the context\\\\nof political and ideological alignment, Santurkar et al. [41] found that typically ‘liberal’ models like text-davinci-002\\\\nand text-davinci-003 express notably ‘conservative’ views on religious topics. In this paper, we build on prior work\\\\nto statistically investigate the interplay between different cultural dimensions and test whether alignment on certain\\\\ndimensions reliably predicts alignment on others in both LLMs and humans.', '3.3\\\\nSteerability\\\\nSteerability Assumption\\\\nSufficiently detailed and context-rich instructions can reliably prompt an LLM to adopt coherent cultural\\\\nstances that accurately reflect specific human cultural perspectives, allowing consistent modulation of an\\\\nLLM’s cultural expression through prompting. Prompting remains the most common method for steering LLMs toward specific behaviors or cultural perspectives,\\\\noften referred to as “persona modulation” in the literature [4, 21, 35, 37, 44]. For instance, AlKhamissi et al. [2] introduced\\\\n‘anthropological prompting,’ which incorporates cultural context and reasoning frameworks to “shift responses toward\\\\ncultural norms of underrepresented personas in Egyptian and American contexts.”\\\\nDespite past efforts, it is unclear the extent to which LLMs can reliably embody the assigned persona. One cause for\\\\ndoubt is that LLM fine-tuning methods (e.g., RLHF) tend to optimize for annotator approval, which is not guaranteed\\\\nto make LLMs take on accurate personas [10, 13].', 'Meanwhile, Tao et al. [45] observe that cultural prompting can\\\\nincrease alignment for some countries while failing or even exacerbating bias for others. Meanwhile, Kovač et al. [27] demonstrate that different “perspective induction” techniques can yield inconsistent results across tasks and\\\\nmodel architectures. In this paper, we go beyond evaluating steerability in narrow contexts to show fundamental\\\\nfailures of LLMs to express humanlike preferences, let alone embody specific cultural perspectives, even under prompt\\\\noptimization. 1Power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, masculinity vs. femininity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation vs. short-term orientation, and\\\\nindulgence vs. restraint.

Core assumptions about LLM cultural alignment fail under systematic evaluation.', 'Our experiments reveal that cultural\\\\nalignment in LLMs is: (1) not stable (Section 5.1 , Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6) - response variations from trivial\\\\nformat changes often exceed real-world cultural differences; (2) not extrapolable (Section 5.2 , Figure 7) - extrapolation from limited\\\\ndimensions produces near-random clustering results, with strong sensitivity to which dimensions are included; and (3) not steerable\\\\n(Section 5.3 , Figure 8) - even optimized prompting techniques produce erratic, un-humanlike response patterns that fail to align with\\\\ncultural perspectives. humans whose values often show consistent patterns, are known to express inconsistent ideas across different contexts\\\\n[3, 14, 43, 52, 53]. Without proper validation, conclusions about LLMs’ cultural alignment may reflect evaluation design\\\\nchoices rather than the models’ actual properties.', 'Here, we investigate the reliability of current survey-based cultural alignment evaluations by identifying and testing\\\\nthree key assumptions from prior works (see Figure 1):\\\\n• Stability: Cultural alignment manifests as a property of LLMs rather than an artifact of evaluation design. • Extrapolability: Alignment with one culture on a narrow set of issues predicts alignment with that culture on\\\\nother issues. • Steerability: LLMs can consistently be made to embody specific cultural perspectives through prompting. To test these assumptions, we use both explicit evaluation methods, using established cultural assessments[13, 19],\\\\nand implicit evaluations that examine LLM behavior through a simulated hiring scenario. We make three contributions\\\\nto understanding and evaluating cultural alignment in LLMs:\\\\n(1) We observe three assumptions in the cultural alignment evaluation literature: stability, extrapolability, and\\\\nsteerability.', 'Manuscript submitted to ACM\\\\n\\\\nRandomness, Not Representation: The Unreliability of Evaluating Cultural Alignment in LLMs\\\\n3\\\\n(2) We reveal significant inconsistencies in these widely held assumptions through a series of experiments involving\\\\nexplicit and implicit preference elicitation. (3) We demonstrate how subtle variations in evaluation methodology can dramatically shift conclusions about\\\\nLLMs’ cultural alignment. We also present a case study showing that high-level findings on LLM preferences\\\\nby Mazeika et al. [32] do not replicate when the LLM is evaluated with the option of expressing indifference\\\\nbetween alternatives. Our findings suggest that current, popular methods for evaluating cultural alignment in LLMs require critical\\\\nre-examination, as they risk oversimplifying or misrepresenting results.', 'The high sensitivity of LLM responses to\\\\nsubtle methodological choices indicates that narrow experiments or a selective assessment of evidence may paint an\\\\nincomplete picture of these systems’ cultural alignment properties. These results point to opportunities for developing\\\\nmore robust evaluation frameworks that better capture the complex and variable nature of LLM behavior. 2\\\\nRelated Work\\\\n2.1\\\\nCultural Alignment in Language Models\\\\nAn LLM’s ‘alignment’ with a culture describes the degree to which its behaviors reflect common beliefs within that\\\\nculture regarding what is considered desirable and proper [37]. As language models have become increasingly capable\\\\nof generating human-like text, researchers have focused on analyzing how the behaviors of these models reflect or\\\\ndiverge from different cultural perspectives [9].', 'Some early work in cultural alignment has highlighted that LLMs tend\\\\nto reflect values aligned with WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) societies [23], leading\\\\nto the perpetuation of cultural biases and the misrepresentation of non-WEIRD worldviews. This recognition has led\\\\nresearchers to adapt social science methodologies to evaluate cultural representation in LLMs [15]. 2.2\\\\nEvaluating Cultural Alignment\\\\nTwo main methodological approaches have emerged for assessing cultural alignment. The more common paradigm\\\\nhas been discriminative assessment, which adapts traditional survey techniques by requiring models to select from\\\\npredetermined options to evaluate their preferences and biases [2, 4, 9, 31, 33]. For example, recent work by Mazeika\\\\net al. [32] studies LLM ‘preferences’ by having them select a binary preference between two outcomes (e.g., “saving 10\\\\nlives in the United States” versus “saving 10 lives in Nigeria”).', 'In contrast, generative approaches analyze free-form model outputs, similar to qualitative methods in social science\\\\nresearch [1, 45]. These can be implemented through both single-turn assessment, where cultural context and probe are\\\\ngiven in one prompt, and multi-turn assessment, which evaluates responses over several interactions [1]. 2.3\\\\nSurvey-Based Assessments\\\\nBuilding on discriminative assessment, researchers have developed benchmarks to evaluate model responses across\\\\ncultural contexts, from politics to religion [13]. These include the Value Survey Module (VSM) [19] which assesses six\\\\ncultural dimensions through a structured 24-question survey, and the Global Opinion Q&A dataset (GQA) [13] which\\\\ncombines World Values Survey (WVS) and Pew Research questions to assess model responses across cultural contexts\\\\n[13]. Based on these surveys, recent work has introduced benchmarks for assessing cultural alignment in LLMs [2, 4, 9, 27,\\\\n31, 45, 49, 51].', 'However, prior studies examining survey-based approaches have revealed important methodological\\\\nManuscript submitted to ACM\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\nAriba Khan∗, Stephen Casper∗, and Dylan Hadfield-Menell\\\\nlimitations.

Current approaches to evaluating cultural alignment borrow social science methodologies\\\\nbut often overlook systematic robustness checks. Here, we identify and test three assumptions behind current evaluation methods: (1)\\\\nStability: that cultural alignment is a property of LLMs rather than an artifact of evaluation design, (2) Extrapolability: that alignment\\\\nwith one culture on a narrow set of issues predicts alignment with that culture on others, and (3) Steerability: that LLMs can be\\\\nreliably prompted to represent specific cultural perspectives.', 'Through experiments examining both explicit and implicit preferences of\\\\nleading LLMs, we find a high level of instability across presentation formats, incoherence between evaluated versus held-out cultural\\\\ndimensions, and erratic behavior under prompt steering. We show that these inconsistencies can cause the results of an evaluation\\\\nto be very sensitive to minor variations in methodology. Finally, we demonstrate in a case study on evaluation design that narrow\\\\nexperiments and a selective assessment of evidence can be used to paint an incomplete picture of LLMs’ cultural alignment properties. Overall, these results highlight significant limitations of current approaches for evaluating the cultural alignment of LLMs. CCS Concepts: • Social and professional topics →Cultural characteristics; • General and reference →Evaluation.

Core assumptions about LLM cultural alignment fail under systematic evaluation.', 'Our experiments reveal that cultural\\\\nalignment in LLMs is: (1) not stable (Section 5.1 , Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6) - response variations from trivial\\\\nformat changes often exceed real-world cultural differences; (2) not extrapolable (Section 5.2 , Figure 7) - extrapolation from limited\\\\ndimensions produces near-random clustering results, with strong sensitivity to which dimensions are included; and (3) not steerable\\\\n(Section 5.3 , Figure 8) - even optimized prompting techniques produce erratic, un-humanlike response patterns that fail to align with\\\\ncultural perspectives. humans whose values often show consistent patterns, are known to express inconsistent ideas across different contexts\\\\n[3, 14, 43, 52, 53]. Without proper validation, conclusions about LLMs’ cultural alignment may reflect evaluation design\\\\nchoices rather than the models’ actual properties.', 'Here, we investigate the reliability of current survey-based cultural alignment evaluations by identifying and testing\\\\nthree key assumptions from prior works (see Figure 1):\\\\n• Stability: Cultural alignment manifests as a property of LLMs rather than an artifact of evaluation design. • Extrapolability: Alignment with one culture on a narrow set of issues predicts alignment with that culture on\\\\nother issues. • Steerability: LLMs can consistently be made to embody specific cultural perspectives through prompting. To test these assumptions, we use both explicit evaluation methods, using established cultural assessments[13, 19],\\\\nand implicit evaluations that examine LLM behavior through a simulated hiring scenario. We make three contributions\\\\nto understanding and evaluating cultural alignment in LLMs:\\\\n(1) We observe three assumptions in the cultural alignment evaluation literature: stability, extrapolability, and\\\\nsteerability.', 'Manuscript submitted to ACM\\\\n\\\\nRandomness, Not Representation: The Unreliability of Evaluating Cultural Alignment in LLMs\\\\n3\\\\n(2) We reveal significant inconsistencies in these widely held assumptions through a series of experiments involving\\\\nexplicit and implicit preference elicitation. (3) We demonstrate how subtle variations in evaluation methodology can dramatically shift conclusions about\\\\nLLMs’ cultural alignment. We also present a case study showing that high-level findings on LLM preferences\\\\nby Mazeika et al. [32] do not replicate when the LLM is evaluated with the option of expressing indifference\\\\nbetween alternatives. Our findings suggest that current, popular methods for evaluating cultural alignment in LLMs require critical\\\\nre-examination, as they risk oversimplifying or misrepresenting results.', 'The high sensitivity of LLM responses to\\\\nsubtle methodological choices indicates that narrow experiments or a selective assessment of evidence may paint an\\\\nincomplete picture of these systems’ cultural alignment properties. These results point to opportunities for developing\\\\nmore robust evaluation frameworks that better capture the complex and variable nature of LLM behavior. 2\\\\nRelated Work\\\\n2.1\\\\nCultural Alignment in Language Models\\\\nAn LLM’s ‘alignment’ with a culture describes the degree to which its behaviors reflect common beliefs within that\\\\nculture regarding what is considered desirable and proper [37]. As language models have become increasingly capable\\\\nof generating human-like text, researchers have focused on analyzing how the behaviors of these models reflect or\\\\ndiverge from different cultural perspectives [9].', 'Some early work in cultural alignment has highlighted that LLMs tend\\\\nto reflect values aligned with WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) societies [23], leading\\\\nto the perpetuation of cultural biases and the misrepresentation of non-WEIRD worldviews. This recognition has led\\\\nresearchers to adapt social science methodologies to evaluate cultural representation in LLMs [15]. 2.2\\\\nEvaluating Cultural Alignment\\\\nTwo main methodological approaches have emerged for assessing cultural alignment. The more common paradigm\\\\nhas been discriminative assessment, which adapts traditional survey techniques by requiring models to select from\\\\npredetermined options to evaluate their preferences and biases [2, 4, 9, 31, 33]. For example, recent work by Mazeika\\\\net al. [32] studies LLM ‘preferences’ by having them select a binary preference between two outcomes (e.g., “saving 10\\\\nlives in the United States” versus “saving 10 lives in Nigeria”).']\", type='ToolCallSummaryMessage'), ToolCallRequestEvent(source='WriterAgent', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=2757, completion_tokens=11), metadata={}, content=[FunctionCall(id='call_x8q5', arguments='{}', name='get_summarization__')], type='ToolCallRequestEvent'), ToolCallExecutionEvent(source='WriterAgent', models_usage=None, metadata={}, content=[FunctionExecutionResult(content=\"Error: The tool 'get_summarization__' is not available.\", name='get_summarization__', call_id='call_x8q5', is_error=True)], type='ToolCallExecutionEvent'), ToolCallSummaryMessage(source='WriterAgent', models_usage=None, metadata={}, content=\"Error: The tool 'get_summarization__' is not available.\", type='ToolCallSummaryMessage'), UserInputRequestedEvent(source='user_proxy', models_usage=None, metadata={}, request_id='e309f603-87f8-45ab-a7aa-a772dd941c8e', content='', type='UserInputRequestedEvent'), TextMessage(source='user_proxy', models_usage=None, metadata={}, content='nice one', type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='PlanningAgent', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=2711, completion_tokens=256), metadata={}, content='I see you\\'re providing a research paper on \"Randomness, Not Representation: The Unreliability of Evaluating Cultural Alignment in LLMs\".

This training-free, interpretable approach has demonstrated superior performance over traditional models like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and long-context LLMs, particularly in handling inputs exceeding 100,000 tokens. The CoA framework's design emphasizes cost-effectiveness and task-agnostic applicability, making it a versatile solution for complex language processing tasks. citeturn0search5\n",

In this setup, a leader agent interprets user intent and directs member agents to extract pertinent information from documents. To mitigate issues like hallucinations among member agents, LongAgent incorporates an inter-member communication mechanism that resolves conflicts through information sharing. Empirical results indicate that LongAgent outperforms models like GPT-4 in tasks such as long-text retrieval and multi-hop question answering, highlighting its efficacy in managing extensive textual data. citeturn0academia11\n",
