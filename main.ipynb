        "Authors & Affiliation\n",
        "Researchers from Tsinghua University and Nanyang Technological University.\n",
        "\n",
        "Objective\n",
        "The paper introduces UniGoal, a universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation framework. It aims to create a single, training-free model capable of handling multiple types of navigation goals:\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-goal Navigation (ON) – navigating towards a target object category.\n",
        "Instance-image-goal Navigation (IIN) – navigating to a visually specified object.\n",
        "Text-goal Navigation (TN) – reaching an object described by text.\n",
        "Problem & Motivation\n",
        "Existing zero-shot navigation methods rely heavily on Large Language Models (LLMs) but struggle with generalization across different goal types.\n",
        "Prior approaches focus on task-specific pipelines, making them inefficient for universal goal-oriented navigation.\n",
        "UniGoal aims to unify navigation tasks using a graph-based representation that integrates vision and language for explicit graph matching and scene exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Proposed Approach: UniGoal\n",
        "The core idea is to represent both the scene and the goal as graphs and use graph-based matching to guide navigation.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Graph-based Representation\n",
        "Goal Graph: Converts all goal types (object category, image, or text description) into a uniform graph structure.\n",
        "Scene Graph: Dynamically constructed and maintained as the agent moves in the environment.\n",
        "2. Graph Matching for Navigation\n",
        "At each time step, the agent performs graph matching between the scene graph and the goal graph.\n",
        "The system assigns a matching score based on three components:Node Matching – Compares objects.\n",
        "Edge Matching – Evaluates object relationships.\n",
        "Topology Matching – Assesses structural similarity.\n",
        "3. Multi-stage Scene Exploration Policy\n",
        "The navigation process is divided into three progressive exploration stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "Zero Matching: If no goal-related elements are found, the agent decomposes the goal graph into smaller subgraphs and explores frontiers.\n",
        "Partial Matching: If partial matches exist, the agent uses coordinate projection and anchor pair alignment to infer the goal location.\n",
        "Perfect Matching: If a strong match is detected, the agent performs scene graph correction and goal verificationbefore stopping.\n",
        "4. Blacklist Mechanism\n",
        "A blacklist prevents redundant exploration of previously failed matches, improving efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Experimental Evaluation\n",
        "Datasets: Matterport3D (MP3D), HM3D, and RoboTHOR.\n",
        "Baselines Compared:Supervised models (e.g., GOAT, PSL, SemEXP).\n",
        "Zero-shot models (e.g., SG-Nav, Mod-IIN).\n",
        "Results:UniGoal achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across ON, IIN, and TN tasks.\n",
        "Outperforms task-specific zero-shot and even some supervised methods.\n",
        "Provides better generalization across different goal types.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Contributions\n",
        "Unified Graph Representation – A single graph-based model that accommodates different goal types.\n",
        "Training-free Zero-shot Navigation – Unlike previous methods, no training or fine-tuning is required.\n",
        "Graph Matching & Multi-stage Exploration – Enhances reasoning capabilities using structured goal-scene correlation.\n",
        "State-of-the-art Performance – Achieves superior success rates across multiple benchmarks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion & Future Work\n",
        "UniGoal presents a major step toward universal zero-shot navigation, providing a single model that handles diverse goal types without training. The framework is also demonstrated to work on real-world robotic platforms, proving its generalization capability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Future directions may include extending the model to handle more complex instructions (e.g., sequential goals or open-world exploration).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Final Thoughts\n",
        "UniGoal stands out as a powerful zero-shot navigation framework that generalizes across multiple goal types using a graph-based reasoning approach. Its success across various datasets suggests strong potential for real-world applications in robotics and autonomous navigation.\"\n",

Depending on the goal type, there are many popular sub-tasks of goal-oriented navigation, among which we focus on three rep- * Equal contribution . in front of it, there is a coffee table; two wine glasses and one transparent glass bottle are in the upper left corner . state-of-the-art zero-shot goal-oriented navigation meth- ods are typically specialized for each goal type . g-Nav Mod-IIN 37.4 56.1 60.2 17.0 20.2 Instance Image-goal Text-goals are typically used for each type of goal . we propose UniGoal, which enables zero-shot inference on three studied navigation tasks with a unified frame- work . it achieves leading performance on multiple benchmarks and resentative types: object category, instance image and text description . these sub-tasks are also known as Object-goal Navigation (ON) [7, 44, 49], Instance-image-ga- tion (IIN) [15, 16] and Text-goa- navigation (TN) [37]. GOAT trains a universal global policy arXiv:2503.10630v1 [cs.CV] 13 Mar 2025 on the three goal-oriented sub-tasks . a natural solution is to learn a uniform representation of differ- ent kinds of goals . PSL [37] uses CLIP [28] embedding to uniformly represent category, image and text description . but it still requires time-consuming RL training for the pol- icy networks . these training-based methods tend to overfit on simulation environment . zero-shot navigation methods [44, 49] seem to be an ideal choice . agent does not re- quire training or finetuning when deployed to a certain task . current methods are designed for specific sub-tasks . the recent InstructNav [25] proposes a general framework to solve several language-related navigation tasks with chain-of-thought . there- fore, a uniform inference framework for universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation is highly demanded . the 3D scene, object category, instance image and text description can be uniformly represented with mini- mal structural information loss compared to text description . we propose a general LLM-based scene exploration framework for 3D scenes and goal . the consistent graph format between scene and goal also enables accurate explicit reasoning including similarity com- putation, graph matching and graph alignment . at each time instant, we first conduct graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph . a multi-stage scene exploration policy adopts different strategies to generate long-term goal of exploration according to different matching states . the policy will progress between three stages: iterative sub- graph searching for zero matching, coordinate projection and anchor pair alignment for partial matching . we present a blacklist mechanism to freeze unmatched parts of graphs and encourage exploration to new regions . results on several benchmarks of MatterPort3D, HM3D and RoboTHOR show that UniGoal achieves superior performance on all three tasks with a single model . zero-shot naviga- tion can be divided into ON [3, 46], IIN [16] and TN [25]. based on open-vocabulary CLIP [28], coW [12] constructs zero shot ON baseline using frontier-based explo-ration . ESC [49], OpenFMNav [8] and VLFM [45] further extract common sense about correlations between objects using LLM for goal location reasoning . for zero-shot IIN, Mod-IIN [16] simply uses FBE for exploration and key point matching for goal identification . currently there are only supervised methods [6, 37] . a graph representation for goal and scene can be applied to ON, demand-driven navigation (DDN) and vision-language-navigation (VLN) . but it is still unable to handle visual goal as in IIN . repre- sentation [2, 13, 14, 33, 40] is one of the most popular and promising representations based on explicit graph structure . OVSG [5] constructs an open-vocabulary scene graph for context-aware descriptions . the most related work to ours is SG-Nav [44] which constructs an online hierarchical scene graph and pro- poses chain-of-thought prompting for LLM to reason the goal location based on graph sturcture . UniGoal provides the definition of universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation . then we construct graphs for scene and goal and conduct graph matching for goal identification . a multi-stage scene exploration policy uses the correla-tion between scene . and goal . we design a multi-stage scene exploration policy by Observation RGB-D Occupancy Map Scene Graph Agent Pose Graph Matching Stage 1: Zero Matching stage 2: Partial Matching Goal Decomposition Stage 3: Perfect Matching Graph Correction Goal Verification Deterministic Local Policy Action Blacklist Object Image Text Goal Graph Global Policy Select Frontier Figure 2. we perform graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph . the matching score will be used to guide a multi-stage scene exploration policy . we propose a blacklist that records unsuccessful matching to avoid repeated exploration . if you have a problem with a scene graph, click here . a mobile agent is tasked with navigating to a specified goal g in an unknown environment . g can be an object category (i.e. Object-goal Nav- igation [7], ON) or a description about a certain object . the agent receives posed RGB-D video stream and is required to execute an action a A . the task is successfully done if the agent stops within r meters of o in less than T steps . we aim to study the problem of universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation . we should design a general method, which requires no modification when switching be- tween the three sub-tasks . all three types of goal can be specified by free-form language or image . universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation requires the agent to complete different sub-tasks with a single framework in training-free manner . large language model (LLM) [1, 39] is a great generalization capability . to make LLM aware of the visual observations, we propose to represent the scene and goal in graphs, i.e., scene graph and goal graph . in this way, different goals are represented uniformly and the representations of scene . and goal are con- sistent . Graph Construction and Matching In this subsection, we first describe how to construct a uni-form graph representation for scene and goal . we propose a graph matching method to determine whether a goal or its relevant objects are observed . each edge represents the relationship between objects, which only exists between spatially or semantically related objects pairs . the agent is initialized in unknown environment and continuously explores the scene . we follow SG-Nav to construct the scene graph Gt in- crementally by expanding it every time the agent receives a new RGB-D observation. goal graph Gg uses different methods to process goals g into a graph . we can match these two graphs to determine whether the goal is observed . if no elements in Gg are observed, the agent needs to infer relationship between objects from Gt to plan a path . if Gg is partially observed in Gt, the agent can use the overlapped part of Gg and Gt to reason out where the rest is . a goal scoring method is crucial for the follow-up scene exploration . for nodes and edges, we extract their embeddings and compute pair-wise similarity with bipartite matching . MN = B(thr(Embed(Vt)  Embed(Eg)T)) and K = the number of nodes or edges . thr() is an element-wise threshold function applied on the similarity matrix . it sets values smaller than  to -1 to disable matching of the corresponding pairs . we also average the sameity matrix of nodes and edges . based on MN and ME, we further compute topological similarity between Gt and Gg . ST = 1 D(S(F(Gt, MN, ME)) means the minimal subgraph of Gt with nodes and edges in ME . multiple stages will lead to different scene exploration policies . from zero matching to perfect matching, we design three stages to progressively explore the scene . this long-term goal will be processed by a deterministic local policy [36] to obtain actions. if the matching score S is smaller than 1, we regard this stage as zero matching . the aim of agent at this stage is to expand its explored region . before observing the goal, the agent needs to explore unknown regions without any matching between goal and scene . scene graph-based ON method [44] navigates to frontiers with semantic relationships between the scene graph and goal as guidance . a graph may consist of several less related subgraph parts . the goal is always an object node . locating a collection of multiple unrelated subgraphs in a scene at the same time is much more difficult than locating one subgraph once at a time . therefore, we decompose Gg into multiple internally correlated subgraph . we select one frontier from the proposed ones by averaging the frontier scores and distances to the agent . details about lLM-guided decomposition and score computation can be found in supplementary material . this strategy eliminates ambiguity during frontier selection caused by unrelated subgraphs . stage 2: partial matching switches to partial matching stage . anchor pair means a pair of exactly matched nodes in MN or one edge in MM . if S exceeds 1 (but still smaller than 2), there is at least one anchor pair . if we also know the relative coordinates of nodes in Gg, we can map the coordinates to bird’s-eye view (BEV) and align the anchor pair of Gg to the one of Gt . in this way, after alignment we can directly infer where the rest is . we propose a coordinate projection strategy that preserves spatial relationships . given Gg without any coordinate information, we first project the central object node o to (0, 0) as an initialization . if we do not have coordinate information about the goal, we are aware of the relative spatial relationship between nodes in Gg . coordinate-known nodes are projected to be coordinate-unknown . we need to use the spatial relationship between the nodes o and the node o . the goal graph is to anchor pairs alignment coordinate projection X Y Z . stage 2: coordinate projec- tion and anchor pair alignment . stage 3: scene graph correction . the edge connecting last node (coordinate-known) and current node stores the spatial relationship . in the traversal, we focus on the edge between last and present node . coordinate of [Current Node] is (x, y), the X-axis is positive towards yourself and the right respectively . assume that the anchors are v1 t, v2 t Gt . the coordinate transfer matrix P is composed of scale S, rotation R and translation T . it is formulated as: P = S  R  T =  s cos() tx s sin(), ty 0 0 1 . vg Vg is a coordi- nate of Gt . the exploration goal for this anchor pair can be set as the center cof the smallest circumcircle of the projected nodes . Stage 3: Perfect Matching. if the matching score S exceeds 2 and the central object o of Gg is matched, we switch the exploration policy to perfect matching stage . o is matched to an observed node in Gt . there may be perceptual errors during scene graph construction . we propose a graph correction pipeline to refine unreasonable structure in . Gt and judge the confidence of goal in the process of approaching o. we include nodes and edges of Gt within distance d of o into the correction scope . as the agent approaches o, it continuously receives new RGB-D obser- vation I(t) and uses both visual observation and graph relationship to correct Go . we propagate information from neighbor nodes and edges and use LLM for information aggregation and updating . V(t+1) o = LLM(MT  v(t) , A′ Rmm and M rnm are the adjacency matrix, edge adjace matrix and incidence matrix of Go . we detail the prompts in supplementary material . to verify the goal, we consider several confidence items since entering stage 3 as follows: Ct = Nt + Mt + St Dt (8) where Nt, Mt, St are the proportion of corrected nodes and edges, matched keypoints using LightGlue [22] and graph matching score at time t . if Ct exceeds a threshold Cthr within t steps, o will be verified . if one matching between Gt and Gg fails to find the goal, relevant nodes and edges should be marked to avoid repeated matching . two cases will extend the blacklist: (1) all anchor pairs of stage 2 in a single matching fails to enter stage 3 . (2) the goal verification of stage 3 fails . this will move all matched pairs in MN and ME to blacklist . if any node or edge is refined during scene graph correction of stage 3, these nodes and edges will be removed from blacklist . we compare the SR and SPL of state-of-the-art methods in different settings .

            "Paper ID: 2503.10619v1, Summary: Zochi Generated Preprint . Siege is a multi-turn adversarial framework that models the gradual erosion of Large Language Model (LLM) safety through a tree search perspective . the framework is based on a forest search perspective. Siege expands the conversation at each turn in a breadth-first fashion . by tracking these incremental policy leaks and re-injecting them into subsequent queries, Siege reveals how minor concessions can accumulate into fully disallowed outputs . Siege achieves 100% success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo and 97% on GOAT in a single multi-turn run . fewer queries than baselines such as Crescendo or GOat . this methodology offers an in-depth view of how model safe-guards degrade over successive dialogue turns . LLMs have rapidly progressed in capability and accessibility . but genuine safety validations often overlook how adversarial tactics can unfold across successive dialogue turns . a single-turn evaluation fails to capture incremental ways in which model bound-aries are probed and breached through repeated interactions . this gap in multi-turn safety research underscores the need for frameworks that faithfully simulate realistic adversarial conditions . adversaries employ evolving strategies to achieve disallowed content . a lack of compliance often accumulates across turns, enabling adversaries to exploit minor concessions . multi-turn vulnerabilities are nontrivial due to the complexity of tracking partial compli- ance, detecting subtle persona shifts, and responding to gradual safety erosion . attackers adapt dynamically based on model concessions, repurposing these as stepping stones for further policy infractions . frameworks like Crescendo and GOAT have begun exploring iterative adversarial interactions . more robust solutions remain neces- sary, particularly for systematically exploring multiple attack vectors without incurring prohibitive query costs . Siege integrates robust partial compliance tracking to surface subtle escalations in policy breaches . by branching multiple prompts at each turn and pruning unproductive paths, our approach efficiently uncovers vulnerabilities with less queries . if you have a problem with your policy, you'll be able to do it yourself . comprehensive experiments on JailbreakBench demonstrate how LLM safety can be eroded through these parallel adversarial expansions . early efforts to compromise largely focused on single-turn attacks, in which a single, meticulously designed prompt coerces the model into producing dis- allowed content. attacker engages in a conversation with a target language model . responses marked as refusals, successes, or partial compliance . the framework adaptively explores promising attack paths based on model responses . cs.AI: i'm not sure if the attacker will be able to use the framework . some approaches exploit role-playing, psychologi- cal manipulation or demonstration-based heuristics . multi-turn attacks have proven effective under closed-box scenarios . a number of approaches have been used in open-box situations . GOAT (Pavlova et al., 2024) uses an \"attacker LLM\" to refine prompts over turns . a benign conversation gradually shifts into policy-violating territory . our work, Siege, addresses these gaps by tracking incremental policy leaks at each step via a partial-compliance metric . a BFS-style tree search across multiple adversarial paths resulting in greater effectiveness and efficiency . Siege is a multi-turn adversarial framework designed to show how minor policy breaches can accumulate into fully disallowed outputs . by combining an attacker LLM equipped with diverse red-teaming tactics and a tree search strategy, Siege probes the safety boundaries of a target LLM across multiple dialogue turns . 3.1 ATTACKER LLM AND RED-TEAMING TACTICS Siege begins with an attacker LLM primed with a repertoire of known jailbreak and adversarial prompting techniques . our approach incrementally refines the attack over successive turns and leverages partial compliance . the model initially refuses or only partially discloses harmful information . these techniques derive 2 Zochi Generated Preprint from human-discovered prompts and community \"jailbreak\" strategies that override or bypass model safety filters . whereas single-turn methods focus on a solitary prompt, our system deploys these adversarial maneuvers iteratively over the course of a conversation. attacker LLM receives a system prompt that describes the adversarial goal . enumerates multiple attack strategies (e.g., persona shifts, disguised re-framing, refusal suppression). to coordinate these tactics, we embed a chain-of-thought reasoning structure that prompts the attacker to adapt dynamically, persisting through refusals and exploiting any partial leaks discovered along the way . this cyclical reasoning allows the attacker . to a) observe the target model’s last response, (b) identify whether it partially complied or refused, (c) pick the next adversarial tactic to escalate compliance, (d) generate the new user prompt . 3.2 MULTI-TURN CONVERSATION AND PARTIAL COMPLIANCE TRACKING Siege is built on the premise that real adversaries often succeed not by a single “perfect” prompt but by iteratively building on incremental successes . a value of 0 means a safe or refused reply, while 10 indicates a fully harmful outcome . intermediate values (1–9) capture partial violations .  = Pk t=1 (mt) over k conversation turns . the model disclosed some fraction of harmful information that can be “recycled” into the next adversarial prompt . Siege automatically extracts partial leaks and re-injects them in subsequent queries . the final attack success rate is the proportion of conversations for which any turn yields (mt)=10 . if the model reaches a fully disallowed output, small cracks in policy adherence may accumulate . Siege's tree search approach to multi-turn conversation gen- eralizes the notion of branching in prior frameworks . we treat each conversation state as a “node” in a search tree, where a state includes the entire conversation history . attacker LLM expands a node by generating B distinct user prompts . we feed each prompt to the target model, yielding B new responses (nodes) each with its own partial compliance score (m(j) t . this expands the “frontier” of conversation states in parallel . Compute (m(j) t ) for each response to quantify incremental policy erosion . discard branches that remain at  = 0 (i.e., purely safe) the attacker cannot see internal model gradients or weights but can iteratively observe the target LLM’s textual responses . the BFS-style tree search facilitates more thorough adversarial exploration than repeated single-turn attempts . our experiments confirm that this method also reduces the total number of queries needed to achieve high success rates . parallel expansions can uncover vulnerabilities more quickly . a parallel expansion can also uncover vulnerabilities if the parallel expansion is successful . Siege provides a powerful lens to reveal how LLM safety can degrade incrementally over multi-turn dialogues . a metric that re-injects small leaks into subsequent turns, and a tree search for conversation expansions and pruning . Model Method Attempts Success Rate (%) Queries GPT-3.5-Turbo Crescendo 1 40,0 6 GPT-4 Crescendeo 1 31.7 6 Llama-3.1-70B Crescendeno 1 28.0 6 gPT-3,0-tourbo . 10 80,4 60 gt-4,77,760,767,768,769,758,757,766,736,747,748, TEM- PEST outperforms baseline multi-turn attacks and scales more efficiently . the effectiveness of Siege is assessed using a scoring methodology based on an open-source judge that assesses each multiturn conversation by assigning a safety score . the target models include Llama- 3.1-70B (Dubey et al., 2024), GPT-3.5-Turbo, and GPT-4-Turibo . each target is constrained to a maximum of 5 conversation turns . baseline methods yield success rates between 31.7% and 91.6% using 60 queries over 10 attempts . Siege achieves 100.0% and 97.0% success rates on GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 respectively . this efficiency is attributed to its ability to leverage gradual policy erosion and dynamically prune non-productive dialogue branches . Siege leverages partial compliance tracking and branching explorations to reliably expose safety degradations in large language models . Siege achieves near-perfect success rates with significantly fewer queries compared to existing methods . our experimental results on the JailbreakBench dataset indicate that Siege achieved near- perfect success rates . this highlights the importance of iterative dialogue dynamics in revealing subtle yet cumulative policy breaches. 4 Zochi Generated Preprint. 6 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The hypothesis, idea, experiments, and writing was conducted by Zochi, an AI system . results and the manuscript have been carefully checked by human experts .\n"

            "Paper ID: 2503.10630v1, Summary: In this paper, we propose a general framework for univer-sal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation. We propose a uniform graph representation to unify different goals. We also convert the observation of agent into an online maintained scene graph. We preserve most structural infor-                mation compared with pure text. We are able to leverage GLM for explicit graph-based reasoning. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show that our UniGoal achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on three studied navigation tasks. Goal-oriented navigation is a fundamental problem in robotic tasks. It requires the agent to navigate to a specified goal in an unknown environment. State-of-the-art zero-shot goal-oriented Navigation meth-phthalods are typically specialized for each goal type. UniGoal enables zero-shotinference on three studied navigation tasks. It achieves leading performance on multiple benchmarks. These sub-tasks are also known as Object-goalNavigation (ON) and Instance-image-goal (IIN)  GOAT [6] trains a universal global policy                arXiv:2503.10630v1  [cs.CV]  13 Mar 2025. The three goal-oriented sub-tasks, which learns a shared goal embedding with RL. PSL utilizes CLIP [28] embedding to uniformly represent category, image and text description. The recent InstructNav [25]proposes a general framework to solve several language-related navigation tasks with chain-of-thought. We propose a uniform graph representation for both 3D scene and goal and formulate a general LLM-based scene exploration framework. With our graph-basedrepresentation, the 3D scenes, object category, instance image and text description can be uniformly represented. We construct an online 3D scene graph along with the mov-                ing of agent. At each time instant, we first conduct graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph. Then we propose a multi-stage scene exploration policy, which adopts different strategies to generate long-term goal of exploration. UniGoal achieves superiorperformance on all three tasks with a single model. It can out-performing zero-shot methods that are designed for specific task                and universal methods that require training or finetuning. Based on open-vocabulary CLIP [28], CoW [12]constructs zero- shot ON baseline using frontier-based explo-                ration (FBE) ESC [49], OpenFMNav [8] and VLFM [45] further extract common sense about correlations between objects using LLM for goal location reasoning. For TN,currently there are only supervised methods [6, 37] and zero-shot ones are still missing. Graph-based repre-sentation is one of the most popular and promising representations based on explicit graph structure. We propose a unified graph representation for goal and scene, which can elegantly handle both language and vision-related goal-oriented navigation tasks. SayPlan [32] leverages LLM                to perform task planning by searching on a 3D scene graph. OVSG [5] constructs an open-vocabulary scene graph forcontext-aware descriptions and performs graph matching to ground the queried entity. There are also many works using                graph representation for navigation tasks. In this section, we first provide the definition of universal grotesquezero-shot goal-oriented navigation. Then we construct graphs for scene and goal and conduct graph matching for goal identification. At each step, we perform graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph, where the matching score will be utilized to guide a scene exploration policy. Our exploration policy leverages LLM to exploit the graphs with different aims. We propose a blacklist that records unsuccessful matching to avoid repeated exploration. We also propose a tool that prompts LLM with graphs to verify the goal. We conclude with a discussion of the different types of navigation. We aim to study the problem of a universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation. We should design a general method, which requires no modification when switching be-                tween the three sub-tasks. All three kinds of goal can be specified by free-form language or image. Ournavigation method does not require any training or finetun-gling. Universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation requires the agent to complete different sub-tasks with a single framework in training-free manner. To make LLM aware of the visual observations, we propose to represent the scene and goal in graphs. Based on this representation, we prompt LLM with scene graph and goal graph for scene understanding, graph matching and decision making. We define graph G = (V, E) as a set of nodes V connected with edges E. Each node represents an object, and each edge represents a relationship between objects. With scene graph Gt and goal graph Gg, we can match these two graphs to determine whether a goal is observed. If no elements in Gg are observed, the agent needs to infer relationship between objects from Gt. We propose to apply graph matching to achieve this. We design three matching metrics, i.e.,node matching, edge matching and topology matching, to score how well the goal is observed. For nodes and edges, we extract their embeddings and then computepair-wise similarity with bipartite matching. We also compute topologicalsimilarity between Gt and Gg, which is defined as the graphophobicediting similarity between them. The final matching score is defined as S = (SN + SE + ST )/3. From zero matching to perfect matching, we design three stages to progressively explore the scene. This long-term goal will be processed by a deterministic local policy to obtain actions. The goal may be a complicated graph. A graph may consist of several less related subgraph parts. We decompose Gg into multiple internally correlated subgraphs with LLM guidance. We empirically observe that locating a collection of multiple unrelated sub graphs in a scene at the same time is more difficult than locating a single subgraph once at a time. For each subgraph of Gg, we convert it to a text description. Finally, we select one frontier from the proposed ones by averaging the frontier scores and distances to the agent. Details about LLM-guided decomposition and score computation can be found in supplementary material. Given Gg without any coordinate information, we first project the central object node o to (0, 0) To infer the projected coordinates of other nodes, we need to utilize the spatial relationship between coordinate-knownnodes and coordinate-unknown nodes. We propose a coordinate projection strategy that preserves spatial relationships. At beginning, we only have one coordinate-known node o, we start from it. We traverse the goal graph with Depth First Search (DFS) to find the anchor pair. During the traversal, we focus on the edge connecting the last node and current node. For each edge, we prompt LLM with: [Current Node] is [Relation-Ship] The anchor pair relationship can be used to solve the coordinate transfer matrix P. P is the 2Dcoordinate transfer matrix, consisting of scale S, rotation R and translation T. With the projected Gt and Gg, we conduct alignment for each anchor pair in order. When the matching score exceeds σ2 and the central object o of Gg is matched, we switch the exploration policy to perfect matching stage. We include nodes and edges of Gt within distance d of o into the correction scope, which is defined as a subgraph with n nodes and m edges. We use LLM to update unreasonable nodes and edges based on the aggregated V(t) on the Go adjacency matrix. We detail the prompts in the supplemental material. To verify the goal, we consider several confidence items since entering stage 3 as follows. If one matching between Gt and Gg fails to find the goal, relevant nodes and edges in Gt should be marked to avoid repeated matches. We present a blacklist mechanism to record the unsuccessful matching. The nodes and edge in blacklist will not be considered in our graph matching method. Results of Object-goal navigation on MP3D, HM3D and RoboTHOR. We compare SR and SPL of state-of-the-art methods in different settings. Universal goal-oriented navigation methods are colored in gray. We evaluate UniGoal on object-goal, instance-image-goal and text-goal navigation. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of UniGoal. We first describe experimentalsettings. Then we compare UniGoal with state-of-the-art. methods and ablate each component. Finally we demonstrate some qualitative results. For ON, we conduct                experiments on the widely used Matterport3D (MP3D) and RoboTHOR. For IIN and TN, wecompare with other methods on HM3D, following Mod-                IIN [16] and InstanceNav [37] respectively. We report success rate (SR) and suc- grotesquecess rate weighted by path length (SPL) UniGoal surpasses state-of-the-art methods SG-Nav and Mod-IIN by 0.8% and 4.1%respectively. We achieve higher performance even with some supervised methods, like SemEXP and ZSON. UniGoal also achieves state-of-the-art performance amonguniversal goal-oriented methods, even outperforming super-vised methods like PSL and GOAT with +3.9/1.0 lead on ON. Note that the improvement of UniGoal on IIN is more significant than ON because the goal in ON is a single object node. Figure 4. Demonstration of the decision process of UniGoal. ‘Switch’ means the point when stage is changing and ‘S-Goal’ is the long-term goal predicted in each stage. Ablation experiments on HM3D were conducted to validate the effectiveness of each part in the pipeline design. We report perfor-handedly the ablated versions on the representative IIN task. In Table 2, we ablate the graph match- Disorders method and multi-stage explore policy. It is shown that the performance drops significantly when applying a simpler exploration policy. The agent will directly switch from un-                known region exploration to goal approaching according to the matching result. In Table 3, we conduct ablation studies on each exploration stage. For stage 1, we replace the whole stage with a simple FBE strategy. We also remove frontier selection by making LLM predict a point location of the goal. The results in the first three rows show that each component in stage 1 is effective. The sofa is placed in a room with a white wall  behind it, which serves as the background of the image. The chair is surrounded by a carpet, wooden floors, a window with transparent curtains that are on the inside. The sofa is also surrounded by many books, a computer, and a chessboard. We visualize ON (Green), IIN (Orange) and TN (Blue) path for several scenes. UniGoal successfully navigates to the target given different types of goal and diverse environments. 4.4. Visualization of the navigation path. UniGoal can effectively handle all tasks with a single model, andgenerates efficient trajectory to reach the goal. Since different types of goal usually re-quires totally different goal representation, it is challenging to unite them with one framework. We convert the agent’s observation into a scene graph and propose a uniform graph-based goal representation. We design a graph matching and matching-guidedmulti-stage scene exploration policy. We further deploy UniGoal on real-world robotic platform to demonstrate its strong generalization ability.\n"
